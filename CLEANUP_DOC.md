# EduSpace Project Cleanup & Firebase Hosting Prep

This document outlines the steps taken to clean and prepare the EduSpace project for local development and Firebase Hosting.

## Steps Taken

1. **Extracted Zip Content**  
   The original ZIP file had a nested structure: `eduspace/EduSpace/`. All relevant files were moved from this nested path to a clean project root.

2. **Removed Redundant Files**
   - Deleted the inner `EduSpace.zip` file that was inside the project directory.
   - Removed development-only directories:
     - `.vscode/`
     - `.idx/`

3. **Cleaned Directory Structure**
   - All files were organized at the root level inside `CleanedEduSpace/` for simplicity.
   - Verified presence of essential files like `package.json`, `next.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`.

4. **Firebase Hosting Readiness**
   - The project contains `firestore.indexes.json` and `apphosting.yaml`, which are useful for Firebase deployment.
   - You can now run the following steps:
     ```bash
     npm install
     npm run build
     firebase init hosting
     firebase deploy
     ```

## Notes
- This is a Next.js + Tailwind CSS project.
- AI-powered logic appears to be in `src/ai/flows/`.
- You can start local development with:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
