## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7), evoking feelings of wisdom, sophistication, and creativity which align well with education and learning.
- Background color: Light purple (#F3E5F5), a very desaturated and bright shade of the primary color that offers a gentle backdrop.
- Accent color: Blue (#3F51B5) creates a harmonious yet contrasting tone for calls to action and interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif), for headlines.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif), for body text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace), for displaying code snippets.
- Use flat design icons to represent course categories, navigation items, and interactive elements to maintain a clean and modern interface.
- Employ a modular card-based layout to organize courses and content. Utilize a sidebar navigation for primary navigation and top bar for quick actions and profile management, inspired by Coursera's structure.
- Incorporate subtle transition animations for page loads and content updates to provide a smooth and engaging user experience.
